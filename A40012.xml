            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O great a Blessing is that of Peace, and so universally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the preservation of Man and humane Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, that in all Ages there hath speciall care been taken for the making of good, and wholsome <hi>Lawes</hi> for the conservation thereof; and from time to time power given by all Princes and Common-Weals to establish the same, tbere being nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven (except the inward peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science) to be compared unto, nor more to be
<pb facs="tcp:109072:6"/> desired then it; a thing very often in the holy <hi>Scripture</hi> both commended and commanded, and a blessing promised to the Makers &amp; Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers thereof: And therefore to this great Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Kings of this Nation have Constituted persons of greatest Integrity, Fidelity, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and Trust, by Commissions to be Conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators therof, which we do call <hi>Justices of the Peace,</hi> as if their chiefe work and businesse were to keep and maintain the same; without which no mans life can bee comfortable unto him; nor can any man promise to himselfe, or hope for security without it; either to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or his Estate, both being exposed to the Lust and Rapine of others who have power to violate the same; whereof in these times we have had too lamentable Experience. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the breach of it is specially enquireable, not onely at the Assizes, and generall quarter Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in every County, but the Justices of the Peace in their severall Limits, have by their Commissions power to call privie Sessions, as well to prevent as to remove all force which tends to the disturbance thereof; and in every Court-leet held either by Grant or prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Steward hath power to enquire of all or most offences against the same; and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers and Magistrates are enabled to bind unruly men to the Peace and good Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb facs="tcp:109072:6"/> for the security of every particular mans person who fearing violence either to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or Estate, doth upon just cause desire it: and thereof every man that stands in feare of either, upon his addresse to the Justices of the Peace, or other Officers may have reliefe, and hath liberty either at the Assizes or quarter Sessions, to indite such Offenders as shall do, or atempt to do any thing contrary to such Lawes as are made for that purpose; concerning which the regular Proceedings are, as hereafter shall be declared.</p>
            <p>And because the proceedings for Offences against the Peace, for the most part are by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments, and upon such Proceedings as do in processe of time terminate the matters in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; I have thought it most methodicall to set down so many of them in the English Tongue as are likely to be made use of; beginning with the most Capitall Offences, as high Treason, petty Treason <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and from thence going on to the Felonies of the highest sort; <hi>viz.</hi> Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Rapes, Sacriledges, Robbery by the high way, and other Felonies which have not the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Clergy; and from them descend to Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies of a lesser size and sort: and last of all for Trespasses and other Misdemeanours; which done, I shall observe some of the Proceedings upon those Indictments in the Crown Office,
<pb facs="tcp:109072:7"/> Goale Delivery, and Sessions of the Peace, to the end, that the unlearned in the Lawes may plainly see both the matter, and form of all such Indictments and business, concerning all, or most Offences against the Peace, and may be acquainted with the manner of proceedings: which I desire to make obvious to the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of such as could not attain thereunto, while the Indictments and Process were in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Tongue, which the Country-man (for whose benefit this Work was principally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken) could not attaine unto, and by knowing what is necessary in and to every Indictment, which are, the Person who, the time when, the place where, the thing taken, the Owner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the manner how, and the intent, comprised in the word Felony; as Mr. <hi>West</hi> in the second part of his <hi>Symboleography</hi> hath well expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; he may finde what is wanting in any such Indictment as he may have occasion to see into: or whether the proceedings concerning the same have been regular; which done, we will shew the way the Ʋpper-bench proceedeth in Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall Causes, and also the proceedings upon Indictments at the Goale-delivery, and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sessions, with such other things as be inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent thereunto; as the Warrants of the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Peace upon severall occasions, the formes of Process against Felons, or other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb facs="tcp:109072:7"/> Indicted, Recognizances, Certioraries, Traverses, the Oathes of Constables, and such other particulars as shall fall within the scope and intention of this Work, whereto, as an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix shall be shew'd the Duties of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Judges Itinerant have by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission power not only to enquire, but also to heare and determine all manner of Offences <hi>contra pacem,</hi> and may therefore enquire of, heare and determine all manner of Treasons, which the Justices of Peace cannot do.</p>
            <p>But for the most part, when any man is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted for high Treason against tbe person of the King, and such other Offences as are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be Treason, by the Statute of 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. the Indictment is in the Ʋpper-bench, and the tryall by Commission under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to some persons of quality, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the privie Councell, assisted by some of the Judges of the one or the other Bench; the Kings, or Common-wealths Councell being ordinarily imployed to give the Evidence, and manage the business.</p>

And first of <hi>High Treason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The severall species whereof are declared by the Statute of 25. <hi>Ed</hi> 3. which being made for the good and safety of the people, was called <hi>Parliamentum benedictum,</hi> and was ratified by a Statute 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>Ca.</hi> 10 &amp; 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>Ca.</hi> 12. &amp; 1 <hi>Mar.

            <p>
               <hi>Inter leges Canuti,</hi> Treasons were reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those wickednesses which by Humane Law were unexpiable or unpardonable.</p>
            <p>And although in times past, the Clergy held
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109072:9"/> themselves priviledged from answering in the highest Criminall Causes, yet this Statute extends to all persons men and women, Ecclesiasticall and Civill.</p>
            <p>Yet if a man not <hi>compos mentis,</hi> or an Infant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the age of discretion (and therefore not a man) do commit Treason, they are not within this Act: And therefore if a man commit Treason or Felony, and confesseth the same, or otherwise be thereof convict, if afterwards he become not of sound me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, but <hi>patitur exilium mentis,</hi> he shall not be called to answer; or if after Judgement he become not of sound memory, he shall not be executed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it cannot be an example to others, which was the intent of the Law, <hi>Co. pl.

               <p>THE Iurors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> present, That A.

               </p>
               <p rend="hangingIndent">And because there is some alliance and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Witchcraft and Conjuration, it is not amiss to set down the Definition of of the one, and the other, as you may find it in the Exposition of the Terms of the Law,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conjuration</hi> is a compact or plot made by men combining themselves together by Oath or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:109072:32"/> to do any publique harme; (in which sence <hi>Tully</hi> calls the evill and seditious practises of <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, Conjuratio Catalinae,</hi> but it is more commonly used for such as have personall conference with the Devill, or Evill Spirits to know any Secret, or to effect any purpose, <hi>Anno</hi> 5. <hi>Eliz. ca.</hi> 16. And the difference betwen Conjuration and Witchcraft, may be said to be this, because the one seemeth by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Invocations upon the powerfull Name of God, to compell the Devill to say, or do what he commandeth, and the other doth rather by a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and voluntary conference, or agreement between him or her, and the Devill or Familiar, to have his, or her desires and purposes effected, in stead of blood or other gift offered unto him, especially of his or her soule, and both these differ from Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Sorceries, because that they are personall conferences with the Devill, as is said, but these but medicines and ceremoniall formes of words, commonly called Charmes without Apparition.</p>
               <p>If a man be Indicted as accessary to murder, as of assent, or procurement, or receiving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if he be taken for this, he may sue forth a Writ, directed to the Sheriffe, that he let him go upon Baile, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the principall be convict or attaint, if they be of good fame, <hi>Fitz H. nat.

                  <hi>Rolles</hi> argued that it was not Murder.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:109072:35"/> for this reason especially, because the Officer was doing an unlawfull act not warranted by Law, and therefore it was at his perill if he were killed.</p>

And if the party grieved by his assise or action of Trespass, do recover by Verdict, or by any other meanes by due course of Law, it be found that the defendant entred into the Land by force, or after his entry, held the same by force, that then the Plaintiff should recover trebble damages against the diffendant and should also make Fine and Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to the King, as in the Statute more at large is contained.</p>

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:109072:118"/> the party who gave the surety is released; And this I am sure is the common practise.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Supersedeas</hi> is a Writ granted out of a superior Court to stay the proceedings in an inferiour, so that a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> out of the Chancery will discharge surety for the Peace in the Kings Bench, and if it be awarded out of either of those Courts, it will stay the execution of any precept granted by a Justice of the Peace; for contempt whereof by proceeding he may be imprisoned and Fined. <hi>Lam. fol</hi> 99.</p>

               <p>But whether a Justice of Peace can grant a <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedeas,</hi> for the good abearing, hath been doubted, which Mr. <hi>Dalton</hi> affirmeth, <hi>fol.</hi> 197.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Certiorari</hi> to remove a Record, is in it self a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persedeas</hi> to the Justices, yet the party may have a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> to the Sheriffe that he arrest him not upon the Iustices Record. <hi>Lamb.</hi> 515. for which take the ensuing Presidents.</p>

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:109072:130"/> upon him, and he is slain by the stroke of one only, and none other hurt him but he, That he that stroke him is principall, and all the others are accessories to the Felony, though he was not strucken by any of the others, but because their intent at first was to do a thing not lawfull they are parties to the wrong. But if no such purpose was at first in these twenty men, as if they went in aide of the Sheriffe, or to do another lawfull act, and by chance one of them strike another that he die, and the others do nothing to him that is slain, no man shall be punished for this Felony, but only he that struck him, and the others are not accessaries in this case. <hi>vide,</hi> note the diversity. <hi>Kelw.

               <p>The King may challenge a Iuror without cause, or the Aray, because the Sheriffe who made it is cosen to the partie, but no challenge can be made against him. 27. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 26,</p>

               <p>A Woman was indicted for felonious taking of bread to the value of two shillings, and being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of arraigned confessed the Felony, &amp; said she did it by the commandement of her husband, &amp; the Iudge

               <p>I have long since seen in a Manuscript a peece of a Sermon upon this Text, which thus began. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the direction was good concerning the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of persons to be chosen for this imployment, but to finde such<hi>—hic labor hoc opus est.</hi> For they must not (saith he) be like <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Priests of the lowest of the people, not unlearned, not ignorant, nor by favour called from the Barr to the Bench, but they must be picked out of the choicest, gravest and most experienced, and most conscientious of their profession. But old men, saith he, such as Iudges were wont (and ought stil to be) are commonly timerous, &amp; will therfore want the courage which they ought to have, and so will want the first qualification, and it is commonly observed, that covetousness cleaves fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est unto old men, who having been getters all their life time, are then loth to give over their old pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, and will therefore want the third qualification <hi>hating covetousness;</hi> and then tells us of a passage in a Sermon Preached by Doctor <hi>Bridges</hi> sometimes Deane of <hi>Sarum</hi> before the Iudges at the Assises ther holden. In which having followed the doctrinal part of his Text, as long as he thought fit, he told the Iudges, that because he did know they were wise and learned men they needed no instruction concerning their duties, and therefore for Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would only tell them a Tale.</p>

               <p>And now my Lords (said he) you that are now Judges, after you were first called to the Barr (if not before) held out your hands for Fees, it may be twice seven years before you came to be Readers, and perhaps seven years more before you were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be Serjeants, and all that time held out your hands for Fees too, and perhaps after you were Serjeants before you came to be Iudges seven years more.</p>
               <p>I pray God that the Custome of holding out your hands so many seven years to take Fees when you were practisers, do not make you hold out your hands still for—now you are Judges; and so ends the Doctors Tale. By which he intimates the force, and in some cases the danger of Custome, and the Comentator out of the premises seemes to draw this conclusion, that old men are timerous and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and would inferr that Iudges being such, will want two of the qualifications before mentioned. I
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:109072:133"/> confess all this may be true if they be considered, <hi>puris naturalibus,</hi> but Grace overcomes Nature, and old men knowing that their dayes are but few, will make the best improvement of their time to Gods glory, and the discharge of their own consciences, knowing what account they are to make in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, for the things done in this.</p>
               <p>And surely it concerns the Common-wealth to begg of God that he will move the Supreame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate to put men of Knowledge and conscience in places of Iudicature, because of the many difficulties which they shall meete withall in their imployment, where their judgments must be much guided by wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses &amp; Jurors sometimes against their consciences, which in case of a mans life is dangerous, and by experience we finde that many have suffered death wrongfully, to which purpose I will (I hope without impertinency) relate a short Story, which was thus;</p>

Seven years after, a Bagg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piper

               <p>This Relation I have made as a Caution both to Iudges and Iurors how they take away mens lives, it being more safe (where the proof is not without exception) to save ten nocent, then to condemne one innocent, And something to this purpose, I shall adde one Story more, the like whereof it may be the Reader never yet did heare of, and thus it was; In the County of <hi>Salop,</hi> about six miles from <hi>Shrewesburie,</hi> there is a Village called <hi>Ruckley,</hi> and a Wood called <hi>Ruckley</hi> Wood; In which Wood one Summer morning about Sun rising, one of the Townsmen found a man newly killed, his blood yet reeking, and immediatly acquainted a Iustice of Peace dwelling fast by with what he had seen, who raised the Country to find the Manslayer: But forasmuch as there had been formerly some unkindness between the man killed, and the man that found him; the credulous multitude would presently have the world beleeve that he which first found the man killed him. A Coroner was sent for, an Inquest sworn upon the view, of which
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:109072:134"/> eleven agreed to finde this man the Manslayer; but one of the twelve not consenting, they were once or twice, adjourned by reason of this mans dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the last adjourment being till the Friday be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Assises, the night before which day, the wife of the accused, and half condemned person dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that this dissenting Iuror could give some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation concerning the death of the man, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired Sir <hi>Humphry Lee</hi> (the Iustice before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) to send for this man and discover what he could concerning the premises, which he did, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the reason of his dissent from the rest of his neighbours, he answered, that in his conscience the man accused was not guilty, what moves you to think so (said the Iustice) do you know any thing of it; yes, said he, for I my self killed him, for which he was the next weeke arraigned and hanged. What a case had the other man (who was innocent) been in if the Manslayer had not been of his Iury, and made a conscience of spilling more blood? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other good caution for Jurors and Coroners too.</p>
               <p>There is therfore one other Ingredient necessary for a Judge, called Discretion, a dram wherof wil sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son a great deal of Learning; now if you ask me what discretion is, I dare not take upon me to give a precise definition; for, though the word <hi>descretio</hi> be crept into the Dictionary, as comming from the Word <hi>Discerno,</hi> yet I have heard a very great Critick say, that the word is not to be found among the ancient <hi>Latine</hi> Writers, nor the elegant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne, nevertheless by our common acceptation, it is a sober and modest management of any business; according to right reason without passion; for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in an undiscreet mans head is like a sharpe Sword in a rash mans hand, and without Discretion

                  </gap> passage which relates unto it, and it was thus; In King <hi>James</hi> his time, Justice <hi>Kingsmell,</hi> one of the Justices of the Common-Pleas riding the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Circuit, did finde in one of the Goales a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary Priest, who was indicted, arraigned, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, which being ill resented by some of his friends, means was made to acquaint the King ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and complained of it as an act of Severity, and contrary to his gracious clemency; The King referred the examination of the business to the Lords of the Councel, who sent for the Judge, and expostulated the rigour of his proceeding in the Case, which he justified, as warranted by the known Laws of the Realme; but some of the Lords told him that he knowing the Kings tenderness in shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, of blood might in <hi>discretion</hi> have forborne the execution. The Iudge replied, That his Majestie, at the end of <hi>Trinity Terme,</hi> in his Speech to the Iudges, willed them to be careful to execute the Laws, and particularly those against Seminary Priests, and that he could not understand the Kings meaning▪ otherwise then by his words, according to which, and the known Laws of the Land, he was sure he had done his duty. But as for the matter of <hi>Discretion</hi> he confessed he had no more then it would please their Lordships to allow him.

In this or such like cases if the Goaler should be punished according to the letter of the Law, it would seem very hard, no man being required to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilites.</p>
               <p>This difference therefore is made; <hi>viz.</hi> if the escape were by default (which we call a negligent
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:109072:137"/> escape) the Keepers of the Liberty of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> may charge the Goaler, if they will, or the Sheriff upon the Statute 14. <hi>Edw</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 9 and the Iudges do in these cases make as favourable exposition as with conveniency and safety they may.</p>
               <p>Or else voluntary, which two sorts of escapes are thus differenced and defined.</p>
               <p>A negligent escape, according to Mr. <hi>Stamford</hi> in his Pleas of the Crown, <hi>fol.</hi> 33. is when the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie arrested or imprisoned doth escape against the will of him that arrested or imprisoned him, and is not freshly pursued and taken again before he hath lost the sight of him which escaped, the penalty whereof seemeth to be openly a Fine at the discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Iudges or Iustices.</p>
               <p>And the same learned man makes this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that if the escape be of a prisoner attainted, the Fine shall be 100 l. but if only indicted, 100 s. and were taken upon suspition only, seemes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable.</p>
               <p>A voluntary escape is where one doth arrest, or hath imprisoned another for Felony or other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and afterwards voluntarily let him go at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty where he will.</p>
               <p>And if the escape be wilfull in the Goaler (which is Felony in him) the Sheriff shall not be bound to answer to the Eelony, but may be fined to the value of his Goods, <hi>Stamf. pl. Coron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in case of voluntary escape, if the arrest or imprisonment were for <hi>Treason,</hi> it shall be adjudged Treason in him, which did voluntarily suffer the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:109072:137"/> prisoner to escape, and if it were Felony, then it shall be adjudged Felony, and if for Trespass, it shall be adjudged Trespass.</p>
               <p>In case of Trespass or other Offences whatsoever (being under Treason or Felony) there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference whether the Escape suffered by the Officer be voluntary or negligent, but that the Officer in both cases shall be fined for the escape according to the dafault, by the discretion of those that be Judges thereof.</p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> pardoned one who killed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the wife of the man slain, suing an Appeale was detained in prison at her suit; the Goaler af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter suffers the Man slayer voluntarily to go at large, and he made an escape; which in Mr. <hi>Plowden</hi> that famous Lawyer his Opinion was Felony in the Goaler, though he was no Felonas to the Queen, in regard of his pardon from the Queen.</p>
               <p>This I believe is a case known to few Goalers, in regard whereof I thought good to set it down, that knowing it, they may be the more circumspect when such a case shall happen, <hi>Plowd.</hi> 147.</p>
               <p>A prisoner found guilty of petty Larceny, is adjudged to lye in prison a moneth for his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and after the moneth he breaks prison, and escapeth; and the question being what this is in the Prisoner, &amp; what in the Goaler; It was holden that the Goaler shall be charged with the escape: But if the prisoner he discharged, paying his Fees, here the Goaler is not charged with the escape, and if he be discharged paying his Fees, he is a prisoner till he hath payed his Fees, 21. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 17.</p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:109072:138"/>
               <p> And it is said that a voluntary escape in Felony is no Felony, if the Act done were no Felony at the time of the escape made: As if one man strike another and hurt him mortally, whereupon the Constable arrests him that gave the stroke, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter suffers him willingly to escape, and after the man so hurt dieth of that stroke, this escape is no Felony either in the Constable or the Prisoner, yet the Constable shall be fined at the discretion of the Iudges.</p>
               <p>If a man be wounded, and the striker is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily let go at large by the Goaler, and after death ensueth to the person hurt, yet this is no felonious escape in the Goaler, 11. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>ca.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>The voluntary suffering him to escape who hath killed another, <hi>se defendendo,</hi> or by disadventure, or of him that hath committed petty Larceny seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be no Felony; for that these Offences are not Felony of death, but he that sufferth the escape shall be fined, <hi>Cromp.</hi> 39. yet there is a Quere, for they that suffered, are not to Judge whether it be Felony or not.</p>
               <p>If a Iustice of Peace shall send for a Felon out of the Goal, and shall deliver him without bail, this seemeth to be a voluntary escape and so Felony in the Iustice.</p>
               <p>If the Iustice of Peace or Sheriffe shall baile one that is not baileable, this is an escape in Law.</p>
               <p>And if one be brought before a Iustice of Peace for suspition of Felony, and confess it, and yet he
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:109072:138"/> shall suffer the prisoner to go at large without baile, that is a voluntary escape in the Iustice.</p>
               <p>If a Goaler by <hi>dures</hi> of imprisonment and pain, enforce his prisoner to become an <hi>Approver</hi> (that is an accuser of others as helpers with him in the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony) this is Felony in the Goaler, although the <hi>Appellee,</hi> or party accused be acquit, or shall dye before he be arrested upon the Appeale.</p>
               <p>If a Goaler shall only procure his prisoner to accuse another of Felony, this is Felony, 18. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. yet the Statute of <hi>Ed</hi> 3. seemeth to extend only where the Goaler shall do this by great <hi>dures</hi> or pain.</p>
               <p>And if a prisoner by <hi>Dures</hi> of the Goaler, commeth to untimely death, this is murder in the Goaler; and the Law implieth malice in respect of the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And for this cause if any man dieth in prison, the Coroner ought to sit upon his body, to enquire whether his death came by the <hi>Dures</hi> of the Goaler. <hi>Briton, Cap.</hi> 11. <hi>de prisons, fol.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>If it shall be further demanded how prisoners for Treason or any other Offence ought to be used in Prison, the learned <hi>Bracton</hi> will tell you; That laying men in Chaines, was against the Law, for that a Prison was a place to keep, not to punish Prisoners, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 154.</p>
               <p>And in another place he saith, when a Prisoner is to be brought before a Judge, he ought not to be brought manacled, though sometimes for fear of escaping, they be shackled. And <hi>Briton</hi> saith, If Felons come in judgement to answer, they shall be
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:109072:139"/> out of Irons, and all manner of Bonds, so that their Paine shall not take away any manner of reason, nor them constrain to answer, but at their free will. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>fol.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. <hi>fol.</hi> 17 he saith. And of Prisoners we will that none shall be put in Irons, but those which shall be taken for Felony, or Trespass in Parks; And we defend that otherwise, they shall not be punished or tormented.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Fleta</hi> saith, That albeit be lawfull for the Sheriff to keep offendors in prison, yet not to punish them, but to keep them.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Mirror</hi> saith, it is an abuse that prisoners be charged with Irons, or put to any paine before they be attainted, <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Sect</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>And whereas in the eighth year of the Raign of <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. a president is brought, that a Priest was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, and put himself upon his Countrey, and stood at the Barre in Irons, but by command of the Judge, he was freed from his irons, Sir <hi>Ed. Coke</hi> who voucheth it, saith, There is no difference in Law between a Priest and a Lay-man, as to irons, and thereupon concludes.</p>
               <p>That where the Law requires that a Prisoner should be kept in <hi>salva &amp; custodia arcta,</hi> yet that it must be without paine or torment to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>And Sir <hi>Ed: Coke</hi> (who cites these opinions, in the conclusion of his discourse of petty Treason) saith, That it is against <hi>Magna Charta. cap.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p>And that all the ancient Authors are against
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:109072:139"/> nine or torment to be inflicted upon the Prisoner before his attainder, nor after, but according to the judgement; and that there is no opinion in the Law Books, or any judiciall Record for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of tortures or torments.

               <p>But how these opinions will secure a Goaler a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his prisoners (who will venture hard for their liberty rather then lye in a straite Prison) because I connot determine, must be left to their discretion, who must answer for their escapes.</p>

               <p>THe next help which a prisoner indicted of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony and found guilty by confession or Verdict, is the benefit of Clergy, which being in some cases allowed, and in some cases denied, I have thought good before I declare in what cases it is denied, to shew in what cases it is allowed, and how the benefit thereof hath been enlarged by divers Statutes.</p>
               <p>Before the Statute of 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Ca.</hi> 5. If a man were indicted of severall Felonies, and had his Clergy for one, the Justices would not deliver him to the Ordinary, but remande him to prison till he were arraigned of the other Indictments, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment should be when the Iustices would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point; for remedy whereof that Statute was made, which willeth that the prisoner shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently be arraigned for all, or else be delivered to the Ordinary, which Statute is confirmed, 18. <hi>El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>z.</hi> Yet the Justices before whom such Clergy shall be allowed, may for their further correction detaine them for any time less then a year in prison.</p>
               <p>The benefit of Clergy is a refuge provided by Common Law in favour of Learning, and at first was not allowed but to Clerks, in order seculer, and religious, as apeareth by the Statutes 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>ca.</hi> 4. and 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. yet now the Common Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it to all the Kings Subjects that could read, as appears, 4. <hi>H</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. in favour of Learning in generall, and in reverence of mankinde, and mans blood, which in persons of use was not to be shed slightly.</p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:109072:141"/>
               <p> The time of claiming the Clergy must not be till after the Indictment, and the offender convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, both for the retaining the jurisdiction over the Clergy, and also to bring forfeiture of goods to the King.</p>
               <p>In giving the Clergy at the Common Law, three things are to be observed. 1. The Court is not to tender it <hi>Ex officio,</hi> but the offender is to pray it, being <hi>in favore,</hi> and a remitting of the rigour of the Law. 2. If the offender pray it, it is not in the power of the Judge to deny it, but it must be allowed him, where by the Law it is allowable. 3. The Ordinary cannot defeate him of it, neither by directly refusing him, or indirectly by practise, by answering the Court that he reades not as a Clerke, when as he did indeed in the judgement of the Court; or if he do refuse him, yet he shall not die; and if the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary will wilfully absent himself, the Court may Fine him, and proceed without him.</p>
               <p>On the other side if the offence be within Clergy, the prisoner may pray the benefite thereof and shall be burned in the hand if he do read, the judgement whereof rests in the breasts of the Ordinary. For though the prisoner cannot reade and the Iudge know so much, and would not allow of his reading, being by prompting, or otherwise, yet if he do but utter any wordes which may seeme to be the words of the <hi>Psalme</hi> (which is commonly the <hi>Psalme</hi> of <hi>Mercy,</hi> and for the most part learned by rote) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out right pronouncing of the words; yet if the Ordinary say that he readeth like a Clerke, though the Iudge may fine the Ordinary for his false in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Court, yet the prisoner shall have the benefit of his Clergy (as some say) and be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:109072:142"/> in the hand, if for Felony with an F. if convicted for a Rogue with a <hi>R.</hi> in the shoulder.</p>
               <p>And Purgation being taken away by Statute, and his Clergy granted him, he shall forthwith be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged and delivered out of the prison by the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices, and is freed both a <hi>paena &amp; culpa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore the Lord <hi>Hobert</hi> held, that if a man should call him that hath had his Clergy, and freed <hi>a poena &amp; culpa</hi> should call him <hi>Felon</hi> or <hi>Theif,</hi> he may have his Action as upon any other pardon; and amounts to a pardon by good construction of the Law.</p>

               <p>And in former times when there were Bishops and Episcopall Government, the Church-wardens with the Minister of the Parish, were within forty

               </p>
               <p>By the ancient common Law the Church-wardens were and still are to care and see to, and preserve the Goods of the Church; <hi>viz</hi> the Church-books, Common-cups, and other decent Ornaments and Furniture of the Church, which they do find there at their comming into their Office: and if there be any lack of those things they are to see and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them, and being there to preserve them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to see the Church repaired; For the taxation of which charge, I find that upon a consultation
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:109072:156"/> among the Doctors of the Civill Law to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of fifteen assembled at Doctors <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> it was directed and agreed upon.</p>

               <p>And it was by them declared, that these parcels ensuing with their appurtenances are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Church reparations, and are to be borne not onely by the Parishoners, but also by all those that do occupy any Lands, Tenements, or possessions within that parish where the Church is to be re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paired;</p>

               <p>That the Taxations of the Poor (which may be a rule for other Assessments too) of any Parish be by Land-scots, according to the quantity and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:109072:157"/> of the acres of Land within the Parish, and to have respect in their Taxations to the ability of the Inhabitants as well as to the lands they occupy.</p>
               <p>That the lands in the hands of Owners and Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers at the Rack rent bear this disproportion; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Owners shall be set 4 d. the acre, and the Farmers at 3 d.</p>
               <p>And because there may not be an unequall and partial carriage in the Taxations, but that the same measure may be towards all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is directed</hi> and <hi>advised,</hi> that together with the Church-wardens and Over-seers of the Poor, there may be joyned an equall number of Owners and Farmers, Inhabitants of the Parish, to be indifferently chosen by the rest of the Parish, upon whose Consciences and Reputation with their severall Neighbours that shall aid, that there be a charitable respect to the poorer sort of Farmers in making the valuation of their lands according to the good discretion of the Assessors who shall be trusted for the whole Parish.</p>

               <p>THus by all that hath been hitherto said, you may see wherein there is a Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Law, by the breach and distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the Peace of the Common-wealth, and the punishment of such transgressions: And all this while we doe but shew the strength and rigour thereof, without any mixture or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of mercy: But as not to punish some were to encourage Malefactors, and evill disposed persons, in hope of Impunity to commit enormous Offences against God and man, so to punish all Offenders according to the letter of the Law, were severity in the fourth degree like poyson, and become cruelty it selfe.</p>
               <p>The Kingly Prophet <hi>David</hi> (a man after Gods own heart) would have his Song of two parts; of <hi>Judgement,</hi> to punish where he should find a continued perversnesse, in the will;
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:109072:161"/> of <hi>Mercy,</hi> to pardon where there was hope of a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mendment in time to come: there being also divers circumstances which may make the same Offence <hi>Veniall</hi> or <hi>Mortall,</hi> as sins are distinguished by some Divines.</p>
               <p>And it was the Method which Almighty God (who is the God as well of mercy as of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice) used with, and towards his own people that had transgressed his Lawes, and broken his holy Commandements and Ordinances, when he had threatned the Israelites, <hi>Hos.</hi> 11. <hi>verse</hi> 6. <hi>That the Sword should abide in their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, consume their branches and devoure them because of their own Counsels</hi> (which was his Judgement.) In the 14 Chap. <hi>verse</hi> 5. he saith, <hi>he will be as the dew unto Israel, and he shall grow as the Lilly;</hi> and verse 6. <hi>His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the Olive Tree, &amp;c.</hi> which was his <hi>Mercy:</hi> and in the 4. of <hi>Amos,</hi> God tells the <hi>Israelites</hi> what punishments he hath, and would inflict upon them, for their oppression and other sins (there is his Justice) and Chap. 9. verse 11. <hi>In that day (saith he) I will raise up the Tabernacle of</hi> David <hi>which is fallen,</hi> (there is his <hi>Mercy)</hi> and some Divines hold, that if one of Gods holy Attributes can be greater then another (he being <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> in the Abstract) it is his <hi>Mercy</hi> that hath
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:109072:161"/> the Prerogative and Preheminence.</p>
               <p>And so it should be (by Gods own example) with Princes who are his Vicegerents, and such as have <hi>potestatem vitae, &amp; necis,</hi> they should mingle mercy with justice; for in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they shall be as much feared, and much more beloved. <hi>Mitius imperanti</hi> (saith one) <hi>melius paretur,</hi> and another thus, <hi>Sicut ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis est ut urat, &amp; lucem prebeat; sic Regis est ut benefaciat &amp; puniat: (id est)</hi> as it is the property of fire to burn and give light, so it is of a Prince to do good, (there is mercy) and to punish (there is Justice of Judgement.)</p>
               <p>The result of all which is, that there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary conveniency, or a convenient necessity (chose you whether) that mercy should be as well sometimes shewed, as justice execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Lawes being made for the terrour of many, that few might be punished. And it was observed, that <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. King of <hi>England,</hi> who cut of coveteousnesse did use to take advantage of the breach of all statute Lawes which were penall, and would bring him in mony, was bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the mark of a cruel King; not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that, <hi>Ditare, non ditescere, Regis est</hi> and as the Poet saith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Si quoties peccant homines sua fulmina mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat</hi>

               <p> Having therefore all this while spoken of Offences and Punishments, it will now (the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses granted) be orderly and seasonable (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Method of that learned Judge, of whose labours I confesse to have made much use in this Collection) to speake somewhat of Pardons.</p>
               <p>Of which some are generall, and some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, some absolute and totall; as where the King doth wholly remit and pardon the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (as it is said in another case) both <hi>à Culpa &amp; poena,</hi> and doth not onely spare the life, and all the Estate which was forfeited upon the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder; but is pleased by authority of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament (without which it cannot be done) that the corruption of the Offenders blood shall also be taken away, so that he shall stand as <hi>rectus in curia,</hi> to all intents and purposes as if he had never offended, which the Latines call <hi>condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio,</hi> a free and full pardon, and in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Law is called <hi>perdonatio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by this authority of Parliament, there may be not onely a restitution in blood to make his Heire capable to inherit from himselfe, or any of his collaterall or lineall Ancestors, but there may be a restitution to Honours, Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and what ever was lost by the attainder.</p>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:109072:162"/>
               <p> There are also some pardons partiall and conditionall, as where there is something annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereunto by way of qualification; as where an offender hath his life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pardoned, yet or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to continue in prison during the Kings pleasure (which is understood to be for his life) or otherwise, or banished the Kingdome, or to be perpetually bound to his good abearing, and is such a qualification of the Pardon, as if the Offender break his condition, he may forfeit his Pardon; as <hi>Shimei</hi> did, who lost the benefit of his Pardon given unto him by King <hi>David,</hi> by going out of the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to which he was confined by King <hi>Salomon,</hi> who put him to death, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 2. chap.</p>
               <p>And albeit I do not for the present remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber but one President which was 3. <hi>H.</hi> 7. of the taking of such a forfeiture by any King of <hi>England,</hi> yet the putting to death of Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> was not far from the case, For albeit he had no formall or legall Pardon for the Offence for which he was convicted; yet some wise men thought, that the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to go to Sea with a Fleet under his command was <hi>tant amount,</hi> and that it was a hard point of Justice to execute him. For I find in <hi>Stamp.</hi> Pleas of the Crown, 22. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. That where a man was found guilty of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony shewed by a Charter of the King, that did
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:109072:163"/> not contain any Pardon, he onely shewed retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to go into <hi>Gasconie,</hi> and it was allowed.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> in his Book of the Pleas of the Crown, and the Chapter of Pardons, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of generall Pardons granted in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, saith, that generall Pardons in those daies in which he wrote; and I may add in these times in which we live, generall Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons had so many qualifications and excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Offences and things, and of persons also, that the Court of Iudicatur (where any man should be impleaded for any Offence for which he was punishable either by paines of death▪ cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, or pecuniary cannot take notice of them, neither can the party take benefit or advantage thereof unlesse he plead it: And for that (as he saith) it may concern the safety and quiet of many a Subject, he was pleased to expresse the form of the pleading of a generall pardon in Latine; which because all Pleadings are now to be in the English Tongue, I thought it worth my Labour for tbe good of others (who may have occasion to make use thereof) to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate the same into English, having for my war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that great Master of the Law, and the learned Judge <hi>Stamford,</hi> who have in their Books translated whole Acts of Parliament for help of the Readers: and thus it is.</p>

               <p>The learned <hi>Stamford</hi> in his Pleas of the Crown <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Ca</hi> 35. saith, That the pardon of the King is a barre to an Indictment, which (saith he) the King ought sometimes to grant to the offender, where there is hope of amendment, and where he may grant it without violation of his Oath, which he made at his Coronation, which among other things (saith <hi>Bracton)</hi> is to command in all Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:109072:164"/> equity and mercy to be done, that by his mercy the mercifull God may be gracious unto him, and by his Iustice all men may rejoyce. For a King (as he saith after) ought not only to be wise, but also mercifull, that with his wisedome he may be mercifully just.</p>
               <p>But because in times past, many procured par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons for very heynous Crimes, which were not truly set down or specified in the Charter, and upon false suggestion divers pardons were granted contrary to the Law, divers Statutes were made for redresse of such deceipts, as 2. &amp; 4. <hi>Ed.</hi> 5. &amp; 14. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. cited by Iudge <hi>Stamford loco citato. fol.</hi> 100. &amp; 101. where he speaks of pardons granted by the King with a <hi>non obstante aliquo statuto actu, &amp;c.</hi> which <hi>non obstante</hi> (saith he) takes away not only the force of those Statutes which limited the Kings power in granting them, as the Statute of <hi>Northampton,</hi> &amp;c. But all other Statutes in which that clause of <hi>non obstante</hi> shsill be put, And that therefore it behooved Princes, well and wisely to consider the suit and suggestion which is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them to grant a pardon, and to see lest by any clause or word contained in their Charter they be deceived. And that the King ought so to do <hi>Bracton</hi> points out two Statutes, the one in 27. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. the other in 13. <hi>Ri.</hi> 2. whereof the first is.</p>

                  <hi>Forasmuch as our Lord the King hath often<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>times granted Charters of Pardon for Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies upon fayned suggestions which were not true, by reason whereof many evils have ensued, which to eschew, it is agreed and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:109072:165"/> assented to by our Lord the King and all his said Councell (his Parliament) that from henceforth every Charter of pardon for Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony which shall be granted at the suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any man, the suggestion and the name of him that maketh it, shall be comprised to the same Charter, and if it shall be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found, that the suggestion was not true, the Charter shall be disallowed and null.</hi>

               <p>That of <hi>R.</hi> 2. was of this tenor; No pardon shall be allowed before any Iustice for murder, or the death of any man slain by a waite, assault or malice prepensed.

               <p>Pardon is a French word, signifying as much as <hi>pax, venia, gratia,</hi> and is used for the remitting or forgiving of a Felonious or other offence against the King. and it is two fold. One <hi>ex gratia Regis</hi> the other by course of Law; <hi>P. Stamf. pl. Cor. fo.</hi> 47.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pardon ex gratia Regis,</hi> is that which the King in some speciall regard of the person, or other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance sheweth upon his absolute prerogative or power. Pardon by course of Law, is that which the Law in equity affordeth for a light offence, as homicide Casuall <hi>&amp;c. West.</hi> part 2. <hi>Simbol. Tit.</hi> Indictments <hi>fect.</hi> 46.</p>

                  <hi>Rickley</hi> was indicted at Durham for murder, and afterwards the Indictment was removed into the Kings Bench, where he pleaded his pardon, which
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:109072:168"/> pardon had these words in it, <hi>viz.

               <p>In Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time at an assembly of all the Judges and Barons, it was moved by <hi>Anderson</hi> Cheife Justice of the Common-Bench, whether men may Arme themselves to suppresse Riots, Rebellions, and to resist Enemies, and endeavour to suppresse such disturbers of the Peace and quiet of the Realme, and it was resolved, that every Justice of the Peace, and other Minister, or other Subject of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:109072:174"/> the King, where any such accident doth happen may do it, which resolution of theirs was grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Statute of 2. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Ca.</hi> 3. the words wherof are recited in the report, and that upon Cry made for weapons to keep the Peace, every man where such accidents happen for breach of the Peace, may by Law Arme himselfe against such evill doers to keep the Peace.</p>
               <p>But they held it to be the more discreet way for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one in such a Case to attend, and be assistant to the Justices, Sheriffs, and other Ministers of the King in doing it. <hi>Pop. rep. fo.</hi> 121.</p>
               <p>It was also at the same time resolved by them all (except <hi>Walsmeley, Fenner</hi> and <hi>Owen)</hi> in the Case of <hi>Richard Bradshaw and Robert Burton,</hi> who with others agreed between themselves to rise and put themselves in Armes, and so to go from one Gentlemans house to another, to pull down inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures generally. And this so appearing by Confession or proofe by two witnesses by the Statute of 13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> is high Treason, and all agreed that Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of subjects against the Queen hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes High Treason at the Common-Law. And the Statute of 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. is, that levying of Warr within the Realme against the King is Treason, and Rebellion is all the Warr which a Subject can make against the King.</p>
               <p>Against which <hi>Walsmeley</hi> and the others vouched the Statute of 1. <hi>Mar. cap.</hi> 12. 10. That if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to the number of twelve or more assemble themselves together to pull down inclosurs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with force, and therewith continue after Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to go away, by the space of an houre,

               <p>But all the other Justices agreed (and so it was put in ure about 36. <hi>Eiz.</hi> against the Prentices of London) that if any assemble themselves with force to alter the Law, or set a price upon victualls, or lay violent hands upon the Magistrate, and with force attempt to put it in Action, that this is Rebellion and Treason, though the Statute of 1. <hi>May.</hi> makes it but Felony. <hi>ibi. fo.</hi> 122.</p>
